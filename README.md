## Improvements

There's a lot of improvements needed.

- Lazy load the Components.
- Storing images on CDN for faster access and optimze images on the fly based on the device and network.
- Backendless BAAS is used to manage User sessions and save orders. The library is quite bloated, considering to migrate to MERN stack.
